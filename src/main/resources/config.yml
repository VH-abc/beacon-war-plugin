# Beacon War Configuration

# Distance between beacons (in blocks)
# Default: 200 (for large-scale games)
# Set lower for testing: 10-20
beacon-spacing: 200

# Nether spacing multiplier (applied to beacon-spacing when in Nether)
# Default: 0.7 (e.g., 200 * 0.7 = 140 blocks in Nether)
# The Nether is more compact, so smaller spacing works better
nether-spacing-multiplier: 0.4

# Number of beacons on each side (total = 2*beacons-per-side + 1)
# Default: 5 (creates beacons -5 to 5, total 11 beacons)
beacons-per-side: 5

# Starting Y level for ground search when placing beacons
# Default: 150
ground-search-start-y: 150

# Win Condition Settings
# Win condition mode: "score" or "beacon_count"
# - score: Team with higher score wins when time expires
# - beacon_count: Team with more beacons wins when time expires
# Note: If a team captures ALL beacons, they win immediately regardless of mode
win-condition: beacon_count

# Game Phase Settings
# Duration of each phase in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes)
# For testing: 60 = 1 minute
phase-duration: 600

# Score interval in seconds (default: 60 = 1 minute)
# Teams get 1 point per beacon controlled every score interval
# For testing: 10 seconds
score-interval: 60 #60000000

# Mining fatigue levels near enemy beacons
# Capturing period level (1-4, default: 2)
capturing-fatigue-level: 1
# Mining period level (1-4, default: 3)
mining-fatigue-level: 3

# Range in blocks to apply mining fatigue near enemy beacons (default: 20)
mining-fatigue-range: 20

# Comeback resistance levels by beacon count
# Index = number of beacons controlled, Value = resistance level (0 = none, 1 = Resistance I, 2 = Resistance II, etc.)
# Default: [2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (Res II at 0-2 beacons, Res I at 3 beacons, none at 4+)
comeback-resistance-levels: [2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Partial Keep Inventory
# Drop mode: "territory" or "absolute_position"
# - territory: 0% drops in home territory during capturing phase, else death-drop-probability
# - absolute_position: drops scale linearly with distance into enemy territory (always applies)
drop-mode: absolute_position

# Probability that each item drops on death (0.0 = keep all, 1.0 = drop all)
# Used by territory mode when outside home territory
# Default: 0.5 (50% chance to drop each item)
death-drop-probability: 0.5

# For absolute_position mode: drop probability increase per beacon distance
# 0.04 = 4% per beacon (at beacon 4's position = 16% drop rate)
progressive-drop-fraction: 0.04

# Beacon Protection
# Radius around beacons where block placement is restricted (default: 5 blocks)
beacon-protection-radius: 5

# Castle Generation
# Whether to spawn castles around beacons during setup (default: true)
spawn-castles: true
# Whether castle walls should have gate entrances (default: false)
spawn-castle-gates: false

# Nether Portal Generation
# Whether to spawn nether portals near beacons in Nether games (default: true)
# Portals are placed a few blocks away from each beacon
spawn-nether-portals: true
